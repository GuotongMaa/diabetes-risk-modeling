# Diabetes Risk Modeling

Predict type 2 diabetes risk from clinical features with interpretable models.

## Problem
Early risk prediction for type 2 diabetes using tabular clinical measurements.

## Approach
Data cleaning, baseline models, and interpretable feature analysis.

## Highlights
- Clinical data preprocessing and baselines
- ROC-AUC/PR-AUC with threshold analysis
- Feature importance for interpretability

## Data
Pima Indians diabetes dataset (`data/diabetes.csv`).

## Project Structure
- notebooks/ - Main workflow notebooks
- data/ - Datasets (as noted above)
- models/ - Model checkpoints (optional)
- results/ - Metrics, plots, and outputs
- assets/ - Figures for README

## How to Run
- Open notebooks in `notebooks/`
- Run all cells to reproduce metrics and plots

## Status
Notebook is ready for rerun; metrics can be recomputed.

## Results Showcase
- Recommended outputs in `results/`: ROC/PR curves, calibration plot, and feature-importance summary.
- Add final figures to `assets/` and link them in this section after reruns.
